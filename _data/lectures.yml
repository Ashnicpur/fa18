  topic: Course Overview, Data Design and Sources of Bias
  description: In this lecture we provide an overview of what data science is at its
    root and the components that make data science a large field with endless possibilities.
    Fundamentally, (data) science is the study of using data to learn about the world
    and solve problems. However, how and what data is collected can have a profound
    impact on what we can learn and the problems we can solve. Along the way, we will
    also touch on what it means to be a data scientist by examining recent surveys
    of data scientists. We will begin to explore various mechanisms for data collection
    and their implications on our ability to generalize. In particular, we will discuss
    differences between censuses, surveys, controlled experiments, and observational
    studies and will also highlight the power of simple randomization and the fallacies
    of data at scale. Welcome to Data 100!

  topic: Data Manipulation with Pandas I
  description: While data comes in many forms, most data analyses are performed on
    tabular data. Mastering the skills of constructing, cleaning, joining, aggregating,
    and manipulating tabular data is essential to data science. In this lecture we
    will introduce Pandas, the open-source Python data manipulation and analysis library
    widely used by data scientists. Through introducing useful Pandas operations and
    paradigms, we will also bring to light new concepts including indices, column
    operations (and their effect on system performance), grouping operations, and
    basic data visualization tools built to accompany Pandas.

  topic: Data Cleaning & EDA
  description: Whether collected by you or obtained from someone else, raw data is
    seldom ready for immediate analysis. Data cleaning is an important skill every
    data scientist should master and it starts with understanding key aspects of the
    data. Through exploratory data analysis we can often discover important anomalies,
    identify limitations in the collection process, and better inform subsequent goal-oriented
    analysis. In this lecture we will discuss how to identify and correct common data
    anomalies and analyze their implications on future analysis. We will also discuss
    key properties of data including structure, granularity, faithfulness, temporality,
    and scope; these properties can inform how we prepare, analyze, and visualize
    data.

  topic: EDA and Visualization
  description: In this lecture we will continue our discussion of EDA and important
    features we should be identifying when given a dataset. Along the way, we will
    start to work through a real-world exercise in EDA using public crime data for
    the city of Berkeley. Through this, we will also introduce tools for data visualization
    using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

  topic: Visualization and Data Transformations
  description: A large fraction of the human brain is devoted to visual perception.
    As a consequence, visualization is a critical tool in both exploratory data analysis
    and the communication of complex relationships in data. However, making informative
    and clear visualizations of complex concepts can be challenging. In this lecture
    we explore good and bad visualizations and describe how to choose visualizations
    for various kinds of data and goals. We will also go into detail on how to identify
    issues with certain visualizations and ways to fix these issues to properly convey
    the message you are trying to show. However, in some cases, directly visualizing
    data can be uninformative. Some examples of these cases include plots with curvilinear
    relationships, large numbers of similar observations hiding core trends in the
    data, and visualizing data with a large number of variables. In this lecture we
    discuss data transformations, smoothing, and dimensionality reduction to address
    the challenges in creating informative visualizations. The Tukey-Mosteller Bulge
    Diagram will come in handy when talking about transformations and is a great tool
    for identifying when data needs to be transformed. With these additional analytics
    we can often reveal important and informative patterns in data.
