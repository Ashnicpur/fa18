  topic: Course Overview, Data Design and Sources of Bias
  description: In this lecture we provide an overview of what data science is at its
    root and the components that make data science a large field with endless possibilities.
    Fundamentally, (data) science is the study of using data to learn about the world
    and solve problems. However, how and what data is collected can have a profound
    impact on what we can learn and the problems we can solve. Along the way, we will
    also touch on what it means to be a data scientist by examining recent surveys
    of data scientists. We will begin to explore various mechanisms for data collection
    and their implications on our ability to generalize. In particular, we will discuss
    differences between censuses, surveys, controlled experiments, and observational
    studies and will also highlight the power of simple randomization and the fallacies
    of data at scale. Welcome to Data 100!

  topic: Data Manipulation with Pandas I
  description: While data comes in many forms, most data analyses are performed on
    tabular data. Mastering the skills of constructing, cleaning, joining, aggregating,
    and manipulating tabular data is essential to data science. In this lecture we
    will introduce Pandas, the open-source Python data manipulation and analysis library
    widely used by data scientists. Through introducing useful Pandas operations and
    paradigms, we will also bring to light new concepts including indices, column
    operations (and their effect on system performance), grouping operations, and
    basic data visualization tools built to accompany Pandas.

  topic: Data Cleaning & EDA
  description: Whether collected by you or obtained from someone else, raw data is
    seldom ready for immediate analysis. Data cleaning is an important skill every
    data scientist should master and it starts with understanding key aspects of the
    data. Through exploratory data analysis we can often discover important anomalies,
    identify limitations in the collection process, and better inform subsequent goal-oriented
    analysis. In this lecture we will discuss how to identify and correct common data
    anomalies and analyze their implications on future analysis. We will also discuss
    key properties of data including structure, granularity, faithfulness, temporality,
    and scope; these properties can inform how we prepare, analyze, and visualize
    data.

  topic: EDA and Visualization
  description: In this lecture we will continue our discussion of EDA and important
    features we should be identifying when given a dataset. Along the way, we will
    start to work through a real-world exercise in EDA using public crime data for
    the city of Berkeley. Through this, we will also introduce tools for data visualization
    using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

  topic: Visualization and Data Transformations
  description: A large fraction of the human brain is devoted to visual perception.
    As a consequence, visualization is a critical tool in both exploratory data analysis
    and the communication of complex relationships in data. However, making informative
    and clear visualizations of complex concepts can be challenging. In this lecture
    we explore good and bad visualizations and describe how to choose visualizations
    for various kinds of data and goals. We will also go into detail on how to identify
    issues with certain visualizations and ways to fix these issues to properly convey
    the message you are trying to show. However, in some cases, directly visualizing
    data can be uninformative. Some examples of these cases include plots with curvilinear
    relationships, large numbers of similar observations hiding core trends in the
    data, and visualizing data with a large number of variables. In this lecture we
    discuss data transformations, smoothing, and dimensionality reduction to address
    the challenges in creating informative visualizations. The Tukey-Mosteller Bulge
    Diagram will come in handy when talking about transformations and is a great tool
    for identifying when data needs to be transformed. With these additional analytics
    we can often reveal important and informative patterns in data.

  topic: Working with Text
  description: Whether in documents, tweets, or records in a table, text data is
    ubiquitous and presents a unique set of challenges for data scientists. How
    do you extract key phrases from text? What are meaningful aggregate summaries
    of text? How do you visualize textual data? In this lecture we will introduce
    a set of techniques (e.g. bag-of-words) to transform text into numerical data
    for subsequent tabular analysis. We will also introduce regular expressions
    as a mechanism for cleaning and transforming text data.

  topic: Modeling and Estimation
  description: How do we pick a number to represent a dataset? A key step in
    data science is developing models that capture the essential signal in
    data while providing insight into the phenomena that govern the data and
    enable effective prediction. In this lecture we address the fundamental
    question of choosing a number and more generally a model that reflects
    the data. We will introduce the concept of loss functions and begin to
    develop basic models. we will explore how calculus can be used to
    analytically and minimize loss functions.

  topic: Modeling and Estimation II
  description: In this lecture we will continue our development of models
    within the framework of loss minimization. In particular, we will explore
    how to numerically minimize loss functions. We will also introduce multidimensional
    models and define the notion of the gradient of a function. To minimize functions,
    we will introduce the widely used gradient descent algorithm.

  topic: Generalization and Empirical Risk Minimization
  description: So far, we have focused on how we can estimate a descriptive
    statistic or more generally the parameters of a model that reflects our data.
    What does this say about the population? How can we generalize beyond what we
    observe? In this lecture we recast our loss minimization approach in the
    context of empirical risk minimization. In the process we will review basic
    probability concepts including expectation, bias, and variance.

  topic: Linear Regression and Feature Engineering
  description: Linear regression is at the foundation of most machine learning
    and statistical methods. We have already introduced linear models in an
    informal way; in this lecture we formalize the setup of a linear model as
    a parametric description of a dataset whose parameters can be estimated
    computationally. We study the normal equations from the perspective of
    optimization and discuss some of the computational issues around solving
    the normal equations. We will then transition to the task of feature
    engineering and describe a range of techniques for transforming data to
    enable linear models to fit complex relationships.

  topic: Bias-Variance Tradeoff and Regularization
  description: There is a fundamental tension in predictive modeling between
    our ability to fit the data and to generalize to the world. In this lecture
    we characterize this tension through the tradeoff between bias and variance.
    We will derive the bias and variance decomposition of the least squares
    objective. We then discuss how to manage this tradeoff by augmenting our
    objective with a regularization penalty.

    overfitting. We will introduce cross-validation as a mechanism to estimate
    the test error and to select the regularization parameters.

  topic: Ethics
  description: Data science is being used in growing number of settings to
    make decisions that impact people's lives. In this lecture we will discuss
    just a few of the many ethical and legal considerations in the application
    of data science to real-world problems. Our guest speaker Joshua Kroll is a
    computer scientist and researcher interested in the governance of automated
    decision-making systems, especially those built with machine learning. He
    is currently a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at UC Berkeley’s School of
    Information, working with Deirdre Mulligan. Before that he received a
    PhD in Computer Science in the Security Group at Princeton University.
    His dissertation on Accountable Algorithms was advised by Edward W.
    Felten and supported by the Center for Information Technology Policy
    where he studied topics in security, privacy, and technology’s impact
    on policy decisions. Joshua was the program chair of this year’s edition 
    of the successful workshop series “Fairness, Accountability, and
    Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT/ML)”.
